Text goes up and down and down.

This is a graphical test and experiment with Unity TextMeshes.

Conclusions:

+ having lots of objects onscreen with 300+ more created each tick is a bad idea
+ c# is viable
+ text encoding is dumb
+ unity's handling of fonts and materials is silly
+ green text is cool

fin, though I'll probably come back to this code periodically and see what I can do with it. 
Rainbow colours maybe?
